Projects for Each Week of Code Camp, and copies of examples from class

Each week after Code Camp there will be a project template for you to work on. All those templates will be available here.

You can copy and paste the code into Replit in order to be able to check your work with the Python code.

Add the project back here as a new fork, and we will show off the results next week!

Also, copies of examples from Enrichment will also be here.

Have a great day and happy coding!
